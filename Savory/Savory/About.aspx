                    !Savory started with four food lovers: Andrew, Derek, Jamie and Dhruv. We are New Yorkers who share a passion for cooking and eating, and who are tirelessly obsessed with taking care of our customers. After too many delivery disappointing meals -- too bland, too soggy, and too slow -- an idea was born. We decided we could no longer be "victims" of delivery and embarked on a journey!

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Among the four of us, we have senior-level experience at some remarkable institutions both within and outside of hospitality, including Jean Georges, Bouley, Soho Grand, The Standard, Riese Restaurants, and McKinsey & Co -- just to name a few. As we've added to our team, we've relentlessly sought out others with similar standards and ideals, and together we hope to change the way New Yorkers think about delivery.
